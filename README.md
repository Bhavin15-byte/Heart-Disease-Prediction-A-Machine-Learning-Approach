Project Title: Comprehensive Analysis of Heart Disease Prediction Models

Description:
Led a data-driven initiative to develop and assess machine learning models for predicting heart disease risk. The project involved the exploration and implementation of three key modelsâ€”Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. Each model was meticulously tuned and evaluated to understand its performance characteristics.

Key Contributions:

Logistic Regression:

Employed logistic regression to model the probability of heart disease occurrence.
Conducted feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy.
Visualized model interpretability through feature importance analysis, contributing to actionable insights for medical practitioners.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier:

Implemented the KNN Classifier to explore its suitability for heart disease prediction.
Experimented with different values of 'k' and assessed the impact on model performance.
Conducted a comparative analysis with other models to identify strengths and weaknesses.
Random Forest Classifier:

Utilized the Random Forest Classifier to capture complex relationships within the dataset.
Explored hyperparameter settings, including the number of estimators and tree depth.
Analyzed feature importance to uncover influential variables in predicting heart disease risk.
Methodologies and Techniques:

Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and correlations in the dataset.
Implemented cross-validation techniques to ensure robust model evaluation.
Utilized hyperparameter tuning methods, including RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, to optimize model performance.
Results and Impact:

Achieved a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each model in the context of heart disease prediction.
Provided medical professionals with insights into key factors influencing heart disease risk.
The project demonstrates expertise in machine learning model selection, implementation, and optimization for healthcare analytics.
